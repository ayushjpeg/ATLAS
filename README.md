#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/25IqrPhxpWc
#### Description:

This Project is all about names of different places. You enter a name of place and the website returns another place starting with the last letter of your input.

The game continues in the same manner you again enter a place starting from the last letter of returned word. Remember the first word has to start with the letter "A".

At the beginning you have to enter the difficulty level and no. of passes, a pass will help you skip when you dont know any name with the given letter, when you have 0 passes left you loose.

Difficultly level can be any positive integer, a difficulty level of 10-20 is very easy and computer might lose in the first turn, a difficulty of 250 is moderate and keeps getting harder as you increase the number. Default value is 250 and 3 for passes.

If you enter any place not present in the database or in case of a typo, the website will return "Word not in database" which means you have to again enter another place with same letter.

You cannot use a name which has been already used in a particular session of game.

You can type pass when you dont have an answer.

When you dont know about a place you can search for it you will get a result from Wikipedia. At times it you might get an error or wrong info when there are multiple articles on Wikipedia with same name or there is no article.
